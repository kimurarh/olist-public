# E-commerce Public Dataset (Olist)

E-commerce (or electronic commerce) refers to transactions conducted via the internet. Every time individuals/companies buy or sell products/services online they're engaging in e-commerce.

Needless to say, e-commerce has been growing rapidly over the years. And the covid pandemic has boosted even more the online sales.

In this project, we'll be exploring a Brazilian e-commerce public dataset of orders made at [Olist Store](https://olist.com/) available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce#). The dataset has information on 100k orders from 2016 to 2018 made at multiple marketplaces in Brazil.
