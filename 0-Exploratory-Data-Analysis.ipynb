    "### Datasets Description\n",
    "- **olist_customers_dataset**: This dataset has information about the customer and its location. Use it to identify unique customers in the orders dataset and to find the orders delivery location. At our system each order is assigned to a unique `customerid`. This means that the **same customer will get different ids for different orders**. The purpose of having a `customerunique_id` on the dataset is to allow you to identify customers that made repurchases at the store. Otherwise you would find that each order had a different customer associated with.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **olist_geolocation_dataset**: This dataset has information Brazilian zip codes and its lat/lng coordinates. Use it to plot maps and find distances between sellers and customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **olist_order_items_dataset**: This dataset includes data about the items purchased within each order.\n",
    "    - **Example**: The `order_id = 00143d0f86d6fbd9f9b38ab440ac16f5` has 3 items (same product). Each item has the freight calculated accordingly to its measures and weight. To get the total freight value for each order you just have to sum:\n",
    "        - The total order_item value is: 21.33 * 3 = 63.99\n",
    "        - The total freight value is: 15.10 * 3 = 45.30\n",
    "        - The total order value (product + freight) is: 45.30 + 63.99 = 109.29)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **olist_order_payments_dataset**: This dataset includes data about the orders payment options.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **olist_order_reviews_dataset**: This dataset includes data about the reviews made by the customers. After a customer purchases the product from Olist Store a seller gets notified to fulfill that order. Once the customer receives the product, or the estimated delivery date is due, the customer gets a satisfaction survey by email where he can give a note for the purchase experience and write down some comments.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **olist_orders_dataset**: This is the core dataset. From each order you might find all other information.\n",

    "- **olist_products_dataset**: This dataset includes data about the products sold by Olist.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
